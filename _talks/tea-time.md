University President Sue Thomas welcomed student Krishna Chebolu for a recent episode.
 
Krishna is a junior mathematics major from Hyderabad, India. He works as a student advisor in Missouri Hall and is active in Missouri Hall Council and Namaste Nepal. During their conversation, Krishna discussed his experience studying at an isolated boarding school on the banks of the Ganges River with limited internet access, and how Truman’s inclusion in a college ranking led him to Kirksville.
 
Other topics of discussion include Krishna’s love of cycling, as well as his unique approach to time management, which he views as energy management.
