Interpreting data and directing resources accordingly is arguably the most difficult task there is after obtaining data. This paper presents a model that filters data using a point system to decide which report, out of the given data, is most deserving of
additional resources and/or attention. After defining different parameters, we elaborate on how the model was made and justify any measurements. The model was tested using a computer program with the given data and has worked, consistently scoring cases of Positive IDs lowly, meeting our expectations (Our model ranks the lowest score first and the highest score last). This model is also capable of adapting itself to new data as it receives it, making it a dynamic and pragmatic tool. Finally, we discuss the future of the
model and how it could work in a changing environment.
