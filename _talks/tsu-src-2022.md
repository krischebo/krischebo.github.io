Developing a strategy for frequent trading based on price data from financial markets is
difficult, but the reward is well worth it. This paper presents a model that recommends a
successful day-to-day trading strategy. Explicitly developed for trading in Bitcoin and gold,
Dynamic Gradient-Indicator (DGI) model identifies the trends of the market prices using the
fundamentals concepts of calculus. This design can be adjusted to many similar market
environments. We show the results of our preliminary testing and discuss the advantages of the
DGI model over other trading strategies.
