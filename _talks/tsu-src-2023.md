The paper explores the human-animal relationship in Kenya's Maasai Mara game reserve. It aims to determine the variables that have the most significant impact on the cumulative health of the reserve. The study uses rates of change of activities rather than the value of activities to establish relationships between variables. The data is obtained from research publications, case studies, and commercial websites related to the reserve and Kenya. The paper proposes a model to illustrate the need for policy and quantifies that need using simulations. The variables studied include the rate of change of life expectancy, the human gain index, poaching, forage availability, grazing, off-roading occurrences, land availability to animals, and tourism. The model is a simplified version of a biological model that is profoundly intricate and complex, and the weights associated with each factor are abstracted as proportionality constants.
