Nonlinear Time Series Analysis (NTSA) is a versatile field with untapped potential, having found extensive use in Finance and Medicine but with underexplored applications in the natural sciences, particularly climate sciences. This paper addresses the question: ’What is NTSA, and how can it be harnessed to model climate variability and related phenomena?’ Beginning with NTSA’s fundamental principles and key techniques, we delve into real-world applications, including modeling the El Niño Southern Oscillation and assessing ozone layer depletion. We also evaluate the predictive capabilities and limitations of various models. Ultimately, this paper provides readers with a comprehensive introduction to critical NTSA concepts and their potential for addressing global challenges such as those in the climate sciences.
